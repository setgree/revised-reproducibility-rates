RECHECKING BLANKEN 2014 INTERPRETATION:

Hypothesis: Moral licensing = Positive self-affirmation → LOWER donations

Results:
- Positive words: M = 4.52
- Neutral words: M = 4.60  
- Negative words: M = 5.10

Pattern: Positive < Neutral < Negative

This means Positive led to LOWEST donations.

Pairwise tests:
1. Positive vs Neutral: t=-0.353, p=.724 (NOT significant)
2. Positive vs Negative: t=-2.346, p=.019 (SIGNIFICANT)
3. Negative vs Neutral: t=1.970, p=.049 (SIGNIFICANT)

CORRECT INTERPRETATION:
- Pattern IS in predicted direction (Positive → lower donations)
- But key comparison (Positive vs Neutral control) is NOT significant
- Only Positive vs Negative is significant

This is PARTIAL support for moral licensing, not "opposite" or "failed replication"

MY ERROR: I said "opposite of moral licensing" which is WRONG
CORRECT: Partial/weak support - pattern right, but not significant vs control
