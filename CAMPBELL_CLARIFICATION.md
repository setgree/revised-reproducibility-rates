# Campbell 2017 - There Are TWO Different Papers!

## The Confusion

When I searched for papers with data but no attempted reproduction, I found "Campbell 2017" with a Figshare URL. But there are actually **TWO different Campbell 2017 papers** in the dataset:

## Campbell 2017 #1 - Journal of Research in Personality
- **DOI**: 10.1016/j.jrp.2017.04.001
- **Data/Code**: https://osf.io/wb6vc/
- **Language**: R (Rmarkdown)
- **Status**: ✅ **Already FULLY REPRODUCIBLE**
  - run_script_final = 1
  - reproducible_final = 1
- **Notes from original coders**:
  - "Rmd file works well"
  - "Many helpful comments in code"
  - "Run easily and figure and results are presented in a clear way"
  - "All results of the paper can be found back in the code"

**This one was already successful - no work needed!**

## Campbell 2017 #2 - Drug and Alcohol Dependence
- **DOI**: 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.08.022
- **Title**: "Impairment of manual but not saccadic response inhibition following acute alcohol intoxication"
- **Data**: https://figshare.com/s/b1640ebe17a405390ad8 (Figshare, 9.12 GB)
- **Code**: None listed
- **Language**: Not specified
- **Status**: ⚠️ **NEVER ATTEMPTED**
  - run_script_final = NA
  - reproducible_final = NA
  - No comments from any coder

**This one was never tried in the original Lakens study!**

## Answer to Your Question

> "What does our original repo say...any record of having downloaded the data back then?"

**NO** - Neither Campbell paper has any downloaded data in this repo because:

1. **Campbell #1** (OSF) - Already reproducible, no need to include in "failed attempts"
2. **Campbell #2** (Figshare) - Was never attempted at all in the original study

The Figshare Campbell was **excluded/not attempted** in the original Lakens et al. (2018) reproducibility study.

## Should We Pursue Campbell #2?

**Probably not worth it:**
- 9.12 GB dataset (very large)
- No analysis code available
- Requires Figshare authentication
- Was never even attempted in original study
- Would need to download paper, read methods, infer analyses

**Better use of time:**
- Focus on papers that were attempted but failed
- Or papers with both data AND code available
